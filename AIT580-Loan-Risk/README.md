# 📊 AIT 580 – Loan Performance Risk Analysis

Analyzed Freddie Mac single-family loan-level datasets (origination + performance) to study delinquency and prepayment behavior using data engineering + machine learning.

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- Built a SQL + Python pipeline to clean and join millions of records, optimizing query performance and memory usage.
- Conducted **feature engineering** (DTI, LTV buckets, payment-to-income ratios) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in delinquency and refinance events.
- Modeled risk using **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**, evaluated with AUC-ROC and confusion matrices.
- Delivered data visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn) and business-ready recommendations on borrower risk profiles.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
SQL (PostgreSQL), Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, GitHub, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation (AUC/ROC, Confusion Matrix)

## 📂 Files
- **/code/** – Python scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling
- **/sql/** – schema creation and query scripts
- **/outputs/** – charts, confusion matrices, and final PDF write-up


## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data engineering: transforming messy raw data into usable modeling datasets
- Predictive modeling: training, tuning, and evaluating ML classifiers
- Business translation: turning technical results into insights for credit risk teams
- Reproducibility: organizing work for reuse and future enhancement
