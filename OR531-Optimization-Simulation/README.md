# OR 531 ‚Äì Analytics and Modeling Projects

## üìå Project Overview
This course focused on optimization, simulation, and decision modeling for real-world business problems.  
The projects emphasized building mathematical models, solving them with analytic tools, and interpreting results for managerial decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Software & Languages:** Python, Excel Solver, Analytic Solver, Gurobi (for optimization)  
- **Techniques Covered:**
  - Linear and Integer Programming
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Multi-criteria Decision Analysis
  - Value Functions and Decision Hierarchies

## üìä Key Projects
- **Optimization Models:** Formulated and solved resource allocation and facility location problems using linear and mixed-integer programming.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Modeled uncertainty in costs and yields; applied risk metrics to evaluate scenarios.  
- **Decision Analysis:** Built value hierarchies, exponential and piecewise-linear utility functions, and multi-attribute decision frameworks.  
- **Final Exam Project:** Integrated Monte Carlo simulation, optimization, and sensitivity analysis into a cohesive case study.
