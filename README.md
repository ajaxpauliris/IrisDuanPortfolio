## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### 1. Indications of Recession (CS504 â€“ Principles of Data Management & Mining)
**Goal:** Predict early warning indicators of the 2008 financial crisis using macroeconomic data.  

- Built an **end-to-end Python data pipeline** with FRED economic data.  
- Applied **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to identify significant predictors such as yield curve slope, federal funds rate, and housing indicators.  
- Achieved **AUC-ROC > 0.9**; selected Random Forest for interpretability and alignment with statistical results.  
- Delivered visualizations of pre- and post-recession shifts with matplotlib & seaborn.  

**Skills:** Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, GitHub, AUC/ROC, SHAP analysis

### 2. Freddie Mac Loan-Level Risk Analysis (AIT580 â€“ Big Data to Information)
**Goal:** Analyze 19M+ Freddie Mac single-family loan records to study loan performance, delinquency, and refinancing behavior.  

- Built and merged datasets in **PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy**, engineered features, and optimized queries for multi-million-row datasets.  
- Applied **classification models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict loan delinquency and refinance risk.  
- Identified **LTV and DTI ratios** as the strongest predictors of loan performance.  
- Produced visualizations and performance metrics (AUC, confusion matrices).  

**Skills:** SQL, Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Data Cleaning, ML Classification

### 3. Operations Research & Risk Simulation (OR531 â€“ Intro to Analytics & Modeling)
**Goal:** Apply optimization and simulation techniques to real-world decision problems.  

- Solved **facility location and cost minimization** problems using integer programming in Excel Solver and Gurobi.  
- Designed a **Monte Carlo simulation** (1,000 trials) to estimate project NPV distributions and risk probabilities.  
- Conducted **chi-square tests and odds ratio analysis** to assess workforce attrition.  
- Applied **decision trees, supervised and unsupervised ML** to business data, generating actionable insights.  

**Skills:** Optimization (Linear/Integer Programming, Gurobi), Monte Carlo Simulation, Decision Trees, Statistical Testing
