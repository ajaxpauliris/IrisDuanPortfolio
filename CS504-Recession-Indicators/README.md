# CS504 – Indications of Recession

This was a graduate group project that analyzed early warning indicators of the 2008 financial crisis using economic data from FRED.

**Group members:**
- Iris Duan – Scrum Master  
- Brian Haggerty – Product Owner  
- Roger Graham – Developer  
- An Huynh – Developer  

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Built a reproducible Python data pipeline with `pandas` + `NumPy`.
- Modeled recession risk using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Achieved **AUC-ROC > 0.9**; selected Random Forest for interpretability and alignment with statistical results.
- Delivered visualizations with `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for economic trends pre/post-2008.

## 🛠️ Skills Used
**Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, GitHub**

## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Time Series Data Handling:** Retrieved, cleaned, and transformed macroeconomic data from FRED.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created lagged variables, yield curve spreads, and recession indicators.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Trained and tuned Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compared classifiers using AUC-ROC and confusion matrices for performance.
- **Reproducible Workflow:** Managed version control and collaboration via GitHub; led Agile ceremonies as Scrum Master.
- **Business Communication:** Translated model results into actionable insights on macroeconomic risk indicators.
